            My name is Landon, and I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Alabama
            in Huntsville. I love solving problems and exploring how code interacts with the real
            world. I'm particularly interested in programming languages like Python, TypeScript,
            C++, and recently Java. I'm always looking for ways to learn and grow my knowledge, as
            there is always something to be learned!

            In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and learning new technologies (or
            even making some of my own!). Currently, I'm focused on creating a game engine in Python

            fun along the way.
